To implement the required functionality, we can use the `find` command to locate all files in the `source` directory and copy them into the `destination` directory while flattening the directory structure.

Here is the `backup.sh` script:

---

### Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define source and destination directories
source_dir="source"
destination_dir="destination"

# Ensure the destination directory exists
mkdir -p "$destination_dir"

# Use the `find` command to locate all files in the source directory and copy them to the destination directory
find "$source_dir" -type f -exec cp {} "$destination_dir" \;
```

---

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Define Source and Destination**:
   - The source directory is `source`, and the destination directory is `destination`.
   - These are explicitly defined as per the problem statement.

2. **Create the Destination Directory**:
   - The `mkdir -p` command ensures that the `destination` directory exists. If it already exists, it does nothing; otherwise, it creates the directory.

3. **Find All Files**:
   - `find "$source_dir" -type f`:
     - Locates all files (`-type f`) within the `source` directory, including its subdirectories.
   - `-exec cp {} "$destination_dir" \;`:
     - Copies each file (`{}`) found by `find` into the `destination` directory.
   - The directory structure is flattened because all files are copied directly into `destination`.

### Example Execution

#### Input Directory (`source`):
```bash
$ tree source
source
├── 1
│   ├── x
│   ├── y
│   └── z
├── 10
├── 2
│   ├── a
│   ├── b
│   ├── c
│   └── d
├── 3
├── 4
├── 5
├── 6
├── 7
├── 8
└── 9

3 directories, 15 files
```

#### Run the Script:
```bash
$ bash backup.sh
```

#### Output Directory (`destination`):
```bash
$ tree destination
destination
├── 10
├── 3
├── 4
├── 5
├── 6
├── 7
├── 8
├── 9
├── a
├── b
├── c
├── d
├── x
├── y
└── z

1 directory, 15 files
```

### Key Notes

1. **Recursive File Discovery**:
   - The `find` command ensures that all files within subdirectories of `source` are located and processed.

2. **Flattening the Directory Structure**:
   - Files are copied directly into the `destination` directory without recreating the directory hierarchy.

3. **Idempotence**:
   - Re-running the script will overwrite the files in the destination directory but will not duplicate or cause errors.

This script adheres to the problem's requirements and ensures correctness for all valid inputs.
